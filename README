The theme uses several third-party resources, namely:
- [Terminus](http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/) font by Dimitar Zhekov (licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1);
- terminal box from the default GRUB2 theme - Starfield by Daniel Tschudi (licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License); the work was also used to create the boot menu and selected item pixmap styles with GIMP;
- a [high-resolution scan](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Johan_Christian_Dahl_-_View_of_Dresden_by_Moonlight_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg) by Hans Peter Klut and Elke Estel of "View of Dresden by Moonlight" - a painting by Johan Christian Dahl, as the background image.
